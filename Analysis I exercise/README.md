# Analysis I exercise
Here are the course materials for the analysis I exercise class. The teacher of this course is [Jungang Li](https://sites.google.com/site/junganglihome/home).

There might be several typos in the materials ~~because Professor Li is quite unreliable~~. The solutions of the exercises are not provided. If you are confused about the problems, you should ask Professor Li in person.

The exercises can sometimes be difficult. Don't get discouraged, do your best! Mathematics isn't learned by studying, it's mastered by practising. When you encounter a problem, act first and then learn. Doing is learning!
